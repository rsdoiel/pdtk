A Question and Ideas
--------------------

- What would be the minimum additional tools besides GNU Make and Pandoc needed to make it easy to maintain my website?
    - blogit, a tool for generating JSON presentation of blog posts and their metadata
    - An RSS generator would be nice
    - A working sitemap.xml generator would be nice
    - Support for recent innovations that Dave Weiner has done with "reallysimple" feeds
    - A simple static web server for viewing the review in the content rendered with blogit or pandoc
    - A way to integrate fountain manuscripts
    - A nice to have would be a way to generate breadcrumb navigation for both blogs and website
        - Maybe this is driven by the top level index page's front matter? Or an index.yaml file?
    - A nice to have would be a LunrJS compatible index generator for integrate search

Verbs
-----

- A set of verbs to processing more complex actions
    - "prep" should expose the simple pre-processor implemented in pdtmpl experiment
    - "blogit" should be a fresh implementation of the blogit CLI from mkpage
    - "rss" should generate appropriate, modern RSS 2.0 for syndication
    - "sitemap" should generate a sitemap for a website and support sub-sitemaps were appropraite
