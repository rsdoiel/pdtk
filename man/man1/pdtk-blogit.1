pdtk blogit provides a quick tool to add or replace blog content
organized around a date oriented file path.

documents for inclusion in navigation.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
I have a Markdown file called, \[lq]my-vacation-day.md\[rq].
I want to add it to my blog for the date July 1, 2021.
I\[cq]ve written \[lq]my-vacation-day.md\[rq] in my home
\[lq]Documents\[rq] folder and my blog repository is in my
\[lq]Sites\[rq] folder under \[lq]Sites/me.example.org\[rq].
Adding \[lq]my-vacation-day.md\[rq] to the blog me.example.org would use
the following command.
.PP
cd Sites/me.example.org pdtk blogit my-vacation-day.md 2021-07-01
.PP
The \f[I]pdtk blogit\f[R] command will copy
\[lq]my-vacation-day.md\[rq], creating any necessary file directories to
\[lq]Sites/me.example.org/2021/06/01\[rq].
It will also update article lists (index.md) at the year level, month,
and day level and month level of the directory tree and and
generate/update a posts.json in the \[lq]Sites/my.example.org\[rq] that
can be used in your home page template for listing recent posts.
.PP
\f[I]pdtk blogit\f[R] includes an option to set the prefix path to the
blog posting.
In this way you could have separate blogs structures for things like
podcasts or videocasts.
