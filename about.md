pttk is a plain text tool kit for writing. The main focus is on static
site generation using Pandoc and Gopher. The metaphor behind the tool
kit is a deconstructed content management system. It is easily scripted
from your favorite POSIX shell or Makefile. It provides a number of
functions including a Pandoc preprocessor called prep, a blogging tool
called blogit, an RSS generator called rss and localhost static content
webserver called ws. In this way you should be able to have many of the
website features you'd expect from a dynamic content management system
like Wordpress without the need to run one.
