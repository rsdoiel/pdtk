abstract: "pttk is a plain text tool kit for writing. The main focus is
on static web and Gopher site generation using Pandoc. The metaphor
behind the tool kit is a deconstructed content management system. It is
easily scripted from your favorite POSIX shell or Makefile. It provides
a number of functions including a Pandoc preprocessor called prep, a
blogging tool called blogit, an RSS generator called rss and localhost
static content webserver called ws. In this way you have many of the
website features you’d expect from a dynamic content management system
like Wordpress without the need to run one."
