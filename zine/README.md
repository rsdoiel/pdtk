Zine
====

Walks a directory structure collating the Markdown documents containing front matter with three attributes, zine_name (name of the zine), zine_volume (volume number of the zine), zine_issue (issue number of the zine) and zine__number (article number of the zine). It then builds a JSON document containing the metadata for the zine.

The idea is that processing the zine metadata should make it easy to assemble a "publication" of a zine issue in PDF and ePub.
