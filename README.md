pttk
====

**pttk** is a plain text tool kit for writing. The main focus is on static site generation supplimenting tools like Pandoc.  The metaphor behind the tool kit is a deconstructed content management system. It is easily scripted from your favorite POSIX shell or Makefile. It provides a number of functions including a blogging tool called blogit, phlogit, JSONfeed, RSS generations and rudementry support for sitemap.xml. Combines with Pandoc and Pagefind you can easily build rich websites and blogs.

A command line tool kit
-----------------------

**pttk** is a program that works on the command line or shell.
**pttk** usage is structured around the idea "verbs" or actions.
Each "verb" can have it's own set of options and command syntax.

The basic usage is as follows

```
   pttk VERB [OPTIONS]
```

Currently there are four verbs supported by **pttk**.

__blogit__
: A tool for manage a blog directory structure and a
"blog.json" metadata file

__rss__
: A tool for generating RSS files from blogit

__sitemap__
: A tool for generating a sitemap.xml file.

__include__
: A "include" text preprocessor including files with via an "#include();" directive.

__blogit__ is a tool to make it easy to separate website generation
from where you might want to write your blog posts. It will generate
and maintain a blog style directory structure. A blog directory structure
is usually in the form of `/YYYY/MM/DD/` where "YYYY" is a year, "MM" is
a two digit month and "DD" is a two digit day representation. It also
maintains a "blog.json" document that describes the metadata and layout for
your blog. __blogit__ uses the front matter in your Markdown documents to
know things like titles, post dates and authorship.  The two **pttk**
verbs "rss" and "sitemap" know how to interpret the blog.json to generate
RSS and sitemap.xml respectively.

The form of the __blogit__ command is

```shell
    pttk blogit PATH_TO_DOCUMENT_TO_IMPORT [YYYY_MM_DD]
```

In this example I have a Markdown document I want to use as a blog post
in `$HOME/Documents/pttk-tutorial.md`.  I'm generating my blog in a
directory called `$HOME/Sites/my-website/blog`.  If I want to "blog" the
document I first change to "my-website" directory and use __blogit__
to update my blog.

```shell
   cd $HOME/Sites/my-website/blog
   pttk blogit $HOME/Documents/pttk-tutorial.md
```

The __blogit__ verb assumes you are in the current working directory
where you have your blog.


By default __blogit__ will use the current date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
for the blog post. If you want to have the post on a specific day then
you include the date for the post in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Here's an
example of posting the tutorial on 2022-08-01 (August 8th, 2022).

```shell
   cd $HOME/Sites/my-website/blog
   pttk blogit $HOME/Documents/pttk-tutorial.md 2022-08-08
```

__rss__ is the verb used to generate an RSS feed from a __blogit__
blog.json file.  The format of the command is

```shell
    pttk rss PATH_TO_BLOG_JSON PATH_TO_RSS_FILE
```

If I want my blog feed to be `feeds/index.xml` in the Wordpress style
for my blog in the `blog` directory I would change to `my-website`
directory and then use the __rss__ as follows.

```shell
    cd $HOME/Sites/my-website
    pttk rss blog/blog.json feeds/index.xml
```

This will generate our `feeds/index.xml` document. If the feeds directory
doesn't exist it'll get created. Updating the RSS picking up new post
is just a matter of invoking `pttk rss` the command again.

__sitemap__ generates a "sitemap.xml" file that describes the site layout
to searching crawlers.  The specification for sitemap.xml stipulates a
maximum number of entries in the sitemap.xml. For large websites this used
to be a problem but the specification allows for multiple sitemaps to be
used.  The __sitemap__ verb will generate a sitemap.xml in the root
website directory and in any sub-directories of the website.  If Markdown
documents are found then it'll use front matter for the matching HTML files
and "blog.json" file for the blog content.

The form for __sitemap__ is simple.

```
   ptdk sitemap [ROOT_WEBSITE_DIRECTORY]
```

Here's an example for our "my-website" directory.

```
    pttk sitemap $HOME/Sites/my-website
```

This wold generate a sitemap file of `$HOME/Sites/my-website/sitemap.xml`
and if necessary ones in the sub directories like `blog`.


Go package
----------

Here's some simple use examples of the three functions supplied
in the pttk package.

Given a JSON Object document  as a slice of bytes render formatted
output based on the Pandoc template `example.tmpl`

```go
    src, err := ioutil.ReadFile("example.json")
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"--template", "example.tmpl"}
    src, err = pttk.Apply(src, opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s", src)
```

Using an `io.Reader` to retrieve the JSON content, process with the
`example.tmpl` template and write standard output

```go
    f, err := Open("example.json")
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    defer f.Close()
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"--template", "example.tmpl"}
    src, err := pttk.ReadAll(f, opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s", src)
```

Using an `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` to read JSON source from standard
input and write the processed Pandoc templated standard output.

```go
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"--template", "example.tmpl"}
    err := pttk.ApplyIO(os.Stdin, os.Stdout, opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
```
