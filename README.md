pdtk
====

**pdtk** is a tool kit for writing. The main focus is on static site
generation using Pandoc.  The metaphor behind the tool kit is a
deconstructed content management system. It is easily scripted
from your favorite POSIX shell or Makefile. It provides a number of
functions including a Pandoc preprocessor called prep, a blogging
tool called blogit as well as an RSS generator. In this way
you should be able to have many of the website features you'd expect
from a dynamic content management system like Wordpress without the
need to run one. 

**pdtk** is a proof-of-concept Go package which makes it easy to extend
your Go application to incorporate Pandoc template processing or develop
other content manage tools. 


A command line tool kit
-----------------------

**pdtk** is a program that works on the command line or shell.
**pdtk** usage is structured around the idea "verbs" or actions.
Each "verb" can have it's own set of options and command syntax.

The basic usage is as follows

```
   pdtk VERB [OPTIONS]
```

Currently there are four verbs supported by **pdtk**.

__blogit__
: A tool for manage a blog directory structure and a
"blog.json" metadata file

__rss__
: A tool for generating RSS files from blogit

__sitemap__
: A tool for generating a sitemap.xml file.

__prep__
: a Pandoc preprocess that accepts JSON and pipes it into
Pandoc for processing


__blogit__ is a tool to make it easy to separate website generation
from where you might want to write your blog posts. It will generate
and maintain a blog style directory structure. A blog directory structure
is usually in the form of `/YYYY/MM/DD/` where "YYYY" is a year, "MM" is
a two digit month and "DD" is a two digit day representation. It also
maintains a "blog.json" document that describes the metadata and layout for
your blog. __blogit__ uses the front matter in your Markdown documents to
know things like titles, post dates and authorship.  The two **pdtk**
verbs "rss" and "sitemap" know how to interpret the blog.json to generate
RSS and sitemap.xml respectively.

The form of the __blogit__ command is

```shell
    pdtk blogit PATH_TO_DOCUMENT_TO_IMPORT [YYYY_MM_DD]
```

In this example I have a Markdown document I want to use as a blog post
in `$HOME/Documents/pdtk-tutorial.md`.  I'm generating my blog in a
directory called `$HOME/Sites/my-website/blog`.  If I want to "blog" the
document I first change to "my-website" directory and use __blogit__
to update my blog.

```shell
   cd $HOME/Sites/my-website/blog
   pdtk blogit $HOME/Documents/pdtk-tutorial.md
```

The __blogit__ verb assumes you are in the current working directory
where you have your blog. 


By default __blogit__ will use the current date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
for the blog post. If you want to have the post on a specific day then
you include the date for the post in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Here's an
example of posting the tutorial on 2022-08-01 (August 8th, 2022).

```shell
   cd $HOME/Sites/my-website/blog
   pdtk blogit $HOME/Documents/pdtk-tutorial.md 2022-08-08
```

__rss__ is the verb used to generate an RSS feed from a __blogit__
blog.json file.  The format of the command is

```shell
    pdtk rss PATH_TO_BLOG_JSON PATH_TO_RSS_FILE
```

If I want my blog feed to be `feeds/index.xml` in the Wordpress style
for my blog in the `blog` directory I would change to `my-website`
directory and then use the __rss__ as follows.

```shell
    cd $HOME/Sites/my-website
    pdtk rss blog/blog.json feeds/index.xml
```

This will generate our `feeds/index.xml` document. If the feeds directory
doesn't exist it'll get created. Updating the RSS picking up new post
is just a matter of invoking `pdtk rss` the command again.

__sitemap__ generates a "sitemap.xml" file that describes the site layout
to searching crawlers.  The specification for sitemap.xml stipulates a
maximum number of entries in the sitemap.xml. For large websites this used
to be a problem but the specification allows for multiple sitemaps to be
used.  The __sitemap__ verb will generate a sitemap.xml in the root
website directory and in any sub-directories of the website.  If Markdown
documents are found then it'll use front matter for the matching HTML files
and "blog.json" file for the blog content.

The form for __sitemap__ is simple. 

```
   ptdk sitemap [ROOT_WEBSITE_DIRECTORY]
```

Here's an example for our "my-website" directory.

```
    pdtk sitemap $HOME/Sites/my-website
```

This wold generate a sitemap file of `$HOME/Sites/my-website/sitemap.xml`
and if necessary ones in the sub directories like `blog`.

The __prep__ "verb" is the most elaborate. It accepts JSON, transforms
it into YAML front matter and pipes it into Pandoc for further processing.
That make it easy to transform the data structures using Pandoc as data
template engine into documents such as web pages.

__prep__'s syntax is elaborate. It's form is

```
    pdtk prep [PREP_OPTIONS] -- [PANDOC_OPTIONS]
```

NOTE: The "--" delimits __prep__'s own options from Pandoc's.
Options on the left side of the "--" are processed by __prep__ and
the options listed to the right of "--" are passed on unchanged to
Pandoc after preprocessing is completed.

Here's an example of processing [example.json](example.json)
JSON document using a Pandoc template called [example.tpml](example.tmpl).

```shell
    pdtk prep -- --template example.tmpl < example.json > example.html
```

A more practical example is transforming a [codemeta.json](codemeta.json)
file into an about page. Here's how I transform this project's codemeta.json
file into a Markdown document using a Pandoc template.

```shell
    pdtk prep -- --template codemeta-md.tmpl \
         < codemeta.json > about.md
```

Another example would be to use __prep__ to process the "blog.json"
file into a BibTeX citation list using a template called 
[blog-bib.tmpl](blog-bib.tmpl).

```shell
    pdtk prep -- --template blog-bib.tmpl \
        < blog/blog.json > blog/blog.bib
```



Go package
----------

Here's some simple use examples of the three functions supplied
in the pdtk package.

Given a JSON Object document  as a slice of bytes render formatted
output based on the Pandoc template `example.tmpl`

```go
    src, err := ioutil.ReadFile("example.json")
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"--template", "example.tmpl"}
    src, err = pdtk.Apply(src, opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s", src)
```

Using an `io.Reader` to retrieve the JSON content, process with the
`example.tmpl` template and write standard output

```go
    f, err := Open("example.json")
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    defer f.Close()
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"--template", "example.tmpl"}
    src, err := pdtk.ReadAll(f, opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s", src)
```

Using an `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` to read JSON source from standard
input and write the processed Pandoc templated standard output.

```go
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"--template", "example.tmpl"}
    err := pdtk.ApplyIO(os.Stdin, os.Stdout, opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
```
